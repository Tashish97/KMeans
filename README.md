**Type      :Clustering**  
**Algorithm :Kmeans**  
**Language  :Python**  
**IDE       :Jupyter Lab**  

Description:  
A Small Project to show how to implement Kmeans.  
k-means clustering tries to group similar kinds of items in form of clusters. It finds the similarity between the items and groups them into the clusters.

## Work Done:  
1. Preparation of data.  
2. Visualization of variables.  
3. Use of **Elbow Metohd and WCSS** to find optimum number of clusters.  
4. Applying best found number of cluster=**5**.  
5. Validating the performance of the model using scatter plot.
